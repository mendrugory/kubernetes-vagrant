# Ingress

Exposing traffic using load balancers have a drawback and complete load balancer is used for only one service-application. Ingresses try to help to serve more than one service. One of the most used is [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

We are going to try to expose two applications (nginx web server and apache web server) through our own ingress. An Ansible role will deploy a Nginx which will route the traffic based on the prefix url:

* /app1 => to nginx
* /app2 => to apache


The virtual machine will receive a public IP which will be accessible by other computers in the same network.

## Start up the Ingress

### Start up the virtual machine

```
vagrant up
```

### Set up the Ingress

It is necessary to pass the IPs of the nodes and the ports of the apps.

```
ansible-playbook ingress.yml --extra-vars "server1=192.168.33.21 server2=192.168.33.22 app1_port=31603 app2_port=32443"
```


> Check the given Public IP.

### Visit the applications through the Ingress

```
curl 192.168.1.144/app1/
```

```
